### Prerequisites: 

1) Sign up for an account on RMACC Summit [per the instructions on the Research Computing website](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access/rmacc.html).

__PLEASE SIGN UP FOR YOUR ACCOUNT AT LEAST ONE WEEK IN ADVANCE OF THE WORKSHOP!__  It can take up to a few days due to the need for CU Denver accounts to be routed through the National Science Foundation XSEDE SSO hub.  We will have a limited number of temporary accounts available for attendees who are unable to obtain an account before the workshop.  

2) Bring a laptop with a Secure Shell (SSH) client software installed.  If you have Mac OS, this is already installed (via the "Terminal" application).  If you have Windows, there are many options such as [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org) and [GitBASH](https://gitforwindows.org).
